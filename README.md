# Machine-learning--accuracy-score
In this project, My goal is to develop a model that would analyze Mobile carrier Megaline subscriber's behavior and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra. I want to develop a model with the highest possible accuracy. In this project, my threshold for accuracy will be 0.75.

In order to do that, i will perform the following stages:

Open and look through the data file

Split the source data into a training set, a validation set, and a test set.

Investigate the quality of different models by changing hyperparameters.

Sanity check the model

Check the accuracy using the test dataset.

# Skills demonstrated in this project:
1. Splitting the data into training, test and validation sets.
2. Training a model using RandomForestClassifier and LogisticRegression from the sklearn library
3. Adjuting hyperparameters for model quality improvement 
4. Using sklearn.metrics in order to check the accuracy of the model
